// Pure decision logic for the `pipeline_compile` RUM vital — no DOM, no `PerformanceObserver`, no
// SDK. `rum-runtime.ts` drives this with real `PerformanceObserver({ type: "measure" })` entries
// and reports through `DD_RUM.addDurationVital`; this module is unit-testable on its own
// (`rum-compile-vitals.test.ts`).
//
// The wire: `src/engine/runtime/gpu.ts`'s `reportCompile` emits
// `performance.measure("<prefix><forcer.label>", { start, end })` beside the existing
// `Compute.precompiled?.(...)` call — called from `compileValidated`'s serial per-forcer path and
// directly from `precompileAll`'s multi-member batch-then-bisect fast path, so it's the one emitter
// regardless of which drain path a forcer took. A page-side RUM
// script can't reach a demo bundle's `Compute` singleton (each demo bundles the engine itself), so
// User Timing is the cross-bundle wire. `<prefix>` is `PIPELINE_COMPILE_MEASURE_PREFIX`, imported
// build-side only (see the module docblock on `../scripts/build-site.ts`'s
// `buildRumRuntimeBundle`) — never imported here, since a plain `import` of anything from
// `gpu.ts` pulls TypeGPU's whole module graph into a browser bundle through `gpu.ts`'s own
// top-level `tgpu.fn(...)` call (measured: 0.56 MB / 170 modules for a probe importing nothing
// but the string constant). This module takes the prefix as a parameter instead, so it carries no
// import of its own.

 *  entries ran concurrently). `ratio < 1` is possible too — a serial drain with idle gaps between
 *  compiles reads below 1, still correctly "not overlapping".
 *
 *  Degenerate case, decided and documented rather than left to divide-by-zero: an empty
 *  prefix-matching batch (`count === 0`) reads `{ count: 0, sum: 0, span: 0, ratio: 1 }` — no
 *  entries carry no evidence of either serialization or overlap, so the vacuous ratio is the
