//     no listener involved.
//   - the `visibilitychange` listener below covers the opposite and more common case (Chrome
//     and most browsers): rAF is fully PAUSED while hidden, so no tick ever runs to set the
//     flag itself, and without this listener `wasHidden` would stay false straight through a
//     background interval. The listener's hide callback (`document.hidden` true) fires while
//     the tab is still backgrounded, strictly before any resume rAF can fire — so it always
//     wins the race, and it stays safe to run from a separate task because it *only* sets a
//     flag; it never touches `state` and never resets.
//
// The reset itself — `resetFrameSampler` — runs nowhere but inside `tick`, synchronously with
// the first visible-frame sample, regardless of which setter got there first. That is what
