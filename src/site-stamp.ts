// The site build's freshness relation — the one fact `out/site/` cannot state about itself.
//
// `check-site.ts`'s artifact clauses (4-7) read `out/site/` as present-tense truth about the
// tree they are run in. That relation did not exist: a demo dir built before a fix, never
// rebuilt, read as a live defect in the current sources. Measured 2026-08-27 — a local
// `out/site/collapse/` built before shallot `bf1c25f` (the `mkdtempSync` parent + slug leaf
// title fix) reported clause 6's scratch-shaped-<title> red on a tree where the fix was
// already in, and a roadmap item was written from it. The artifact's own mtime (22:52) sat
// *after* the fix commit (22:50), so a timestamp comparison against the commit would not have
// caught it either — mtime records when bytes were written, not what they were written from.
//
// So the relation is content-derived: the build records, per demo, a fingerprint of everything
// it built that demo *from*; the check recomputes the fingerprint from the current tree and
// compares. Equal means the artifact is a build of these sources and may be judged. Unequal
// (or unstamped) means the artifact is a build of some other sources and the artifact clauses
// have nothing to say about this tree — they refuse rather than report.
//
// The fingerprint's inputs are the demo's *build* inputs, no more:
//   - every git-tracked file under `examples/showcase/<slug>/`, path and content. Tracked, not
//     `readdirSync` — the same law `site/roster.ts` and `scripts/check-docs.ts` write for their
//     own populations: a scope that reads local `dist/`/`node_modules/` residue makes the
//     fingerprint depend on which checkout ran it. A tracked file absent from disk hashes as a
//     `missing` marker, so a deletion in progress reads stale rather than identical.
//   - the builders: `scripts/build-site.ts` (eject + inject) and the `site/rum-*` modules whose
//     literals land in every built page. A change here changes every demo's output with no
//     showcase file touched — the founding defect's own shape, since `bf1c25f` was a
//     `build-site.ts` change.
//   - the release version from `package.json` — the pin `build-site.ts` writes
//     into each ejected `package.json`, so a version bump means the artifact was built against
//     a different published package.
//
// Not an input: `**` source. Each demo is ejected and installed against the
// *published* engine package, so in-repo engine edits do not reach the artifact until a release
// changes the version. Tracked source under each workspace extension a demo declares is an input,
// because build-site packs that extension and installs its tarball in both modes.
